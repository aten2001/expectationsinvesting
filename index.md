## Spring 2020 Final Project: Expectations Investing

## Motivation

Our objective is to infer stock market expectations of future company performance. In its simplest form, a stock price represents all future expectations about a company. But the stock market is ‘wrong’ many times and miscalculates future performance. Herein lies the opportunity for an investor: if he has a confident view on a company’s future performance and suspects the market’s expectations of said performance are wrong, then he has a chance to profitably trade the company’s stock. This concept is a fundamental cornerstone of investing.

As such, our goal is to predict when the market will miscalculate future company performance. To our knowledge, this is a completely novel approach. We will first infer the market’s expectations (using a concept called ‘expectations investing’), then compare those to actual performance. Finally, we will investigate what features are most important in causing the market to miscalculate performance. We will assess the quality of our model and also calculate the hypothetical return of an opportunistic investor that has foreknowledge of the market’s miscalculations. To be clear, we are not trying to predict stock returns.


## Background

### A Brief Primer Into Calculating Stock Prices

For context, we need to briefly discuss the calculation of stock prices. This will explain exactly what we are calculating in our model. In the most basic form, the traditional method of calculating the total value of a company is a summation of the all the future cash flows expected to be generated by the company:

(i) Company value (today) = Sum(cash_flow_i) for i = 1 to infinity

In reality, each future cash flow is discounted by some discount factor (the “weighted average cost of capital,” or WACC) because the future generally carries more risk. So the formula becomes this:

(ii) Company value (today) = Sum(cash_flow_i / (1 + WACC^i)) for i = 1 to infinity

To derive each cash flow, for simplicity we assume some growth rate from today’s cash flow (cash_flow_0^i). But note that the summation goes to infinity and since no business can grow into infinite value, we have to make some adjustments. We assume the company’s cash flow will grow at some rate g1 for the nearterm (say, 10 years), then another rate g2 into perpetuity. So the formula becomes:

(iii) Company value (today)  = Sum(cash_flow_0 * \[(1 + g1) / (1 + WACC)\]^i) for i = 1 to 10 + Sum(cash_flow_10 * \[(1+g2) / (1 + WACC)\]^i) for i = 11 to infinity

Note that the second term of the right side is a perpetuity. So we can rewrite the equation:

(iv) Company value (today)  = Sum(cash_flow_0 * \[(1 + g1) / (1 + WACC)\]^i) for i = 1 to 10 + cash_flow_10 * (1 / \[WACC - g2\])

Finally, to derive the current stock price, we simply divide the company value by the company’s diluted shares outstanding. For more information about this calculation, see the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow

### Expectations Investing

The preceding section describes how an investor derives his own opinion of a company’s stock price. But what if we want to do the reverse? That is, the stock market’s opinion of value is simply the price a stock trades at any given time; how can we then derive the stock’s markets implicit assumptions of a company’s cash flow growth? In the framework we laid out so far, this means **we want to solve for g1 (the near-term growth rate of cash flows)**. We will then compare the ‘market-implied’ expectation of g1 to the actual near-term growth rate realized by each company. For simplicity, we assessed the 1-year growth in cash flow. 

It is straightforward to solve for the price-implied expectation of g1 by using optimization software. In equation (iv), we know the values of all the variables except for g1 and g2. Typically, g2 is assumed to be some rate lower than inflation (otherwise, the company would exceed the value of the world, which is impossible). For a deep dive into this concept of price-implied expectations of financial performance and for the inspiration behind our approach, see the following link: http://www.expectationsinvesting.com/default.shtml
